## Caution
Since your repository may be public after you Fork this repository. Modifying the configuration file directly may expose your panel's key information. We recommend downloading `config.yml` and uploading it to your own server after modifying the information. And fill in the `install.sh` with your own config file download link. Finally, upload `install.sh` to your own server to generate your own one-click installation command.
